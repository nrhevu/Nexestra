# Nexestra

Nexestra is a local-first workspace where people can chat and work with coding agents.
Milestone M9 is a fresh rebuild focused on two primary workflows:

- create **Worker agents** powered by Codex or OpenCode;
- create **Master agents** using ChatGPT OAuth through Codex CLI or an OpenAI-compatible endpoint;
- chat in shared threads and invoke agents only with an `@handle`;
- manage tasks and agents in the first two surfaces: Taskboard and Agents.

Workspaces are selected from the far-left rail. Each workspace has its own threads, agents, and
tasks; Threads, Surfaces, and Settings live in the navigation panel beside that rail. Creating a
workspace also creates its initial `general` thread.

## Run locally

Requires Node.js 24+ and pnpm 11.

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:5173`. The backend binds only to loopback on port `4242`.
Change the port with `NEXESTRA_PORT`.

By default, data is stored in `.nexestra/` in the running repository:

```text
.nexestra/
├── state.json          # workspace, agent, thread, and task metadata
├── credentials.json    # custom API keys, mode 0600
└── threads/
    └── <thread-id>.jsonl  # the thread's shared append-only transcript
```

Set `NEXESTRA_HOME=/another/path` to keep data outside the repository.

## Invoking agents

Messages without a mention are only saved to the transcript. A message containing `@maya`,
`@codex`, or multiple handles creates one run for each invoked agent. Agent replies are recorded
in the same transcript file. Agent replies do not trigger other agents, which prevents loops.

Workers run in read-only discussion mode in the MVP. The Taskboard currently organizes work but
does not dispatch agents automatically.

## Agent lifecycle

Disabling an agent removes it from the mention picker without deleting its configuration. Archiving
also keeps the profile and any saved credential, and archived agents remain available in the Agent
management surface for permanent deletion. Deleting an idle agent removes its profile and saved
credential, unassigns its current tasks, and releases its handle for reuse. Shared thread history is
append-only, so existing messages remain attributed to the deleted agent. Agents with queued or
running work cannot be deleted until that work finishes.

When creating a Worker, the model and reasoning effort are optional. Leaving either field blank
uses the selected harness default. Codex receives the model and `model_reasoning_effort` overrides;
OpenCode receives `--model` (in `provider/model` form) and the provider-specific `--variant`.

## Provider

- **ChatGPT OAuth:** install Codex CLI and run `codex login`, or click Connect in the Master
  creation form. Codex CLI manages OAuth tokens; Nexestra never reads or stores them.
- **Custom:** enter an API root and model, then select OpenAI Chat Completions or OpenAI Responses.
  The API key may be left blank for a local endpoint. Remote endpoints must use HTTPS; HTTP is
  accepted only on loopback.

## Verification

```bash
pnpm lint
pnpm typecheck
pnpm test
pnpm build
# or run everything:
pnpm check
```

Default tests do not call paid providers and do not require a Codex or OpenCode account.
